### Cleaning:
#### Disease Data:
The raw disease data contained information about key statistics (cases, deaths, recoveries) for the affected countries on a day by day basis. Several enhanbements were needed to make the data usable for analysis. 

1. Stray characters were removed from the dataset 
2. Country names were standardized across datasets
3. Data was grouped by week since disease onset to normalize the datasets to one another allowing the analyst to compare apples to apples
