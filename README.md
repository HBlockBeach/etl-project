## Project Background:
From smallpox to typhoid, epidemics have plagued humans for all of history. In more recent history we have been hit by SARS-CoV (SARS, 2002), A/H1N1 (swine flu/spanish flu, 2009), and SARS-CoV2 (COVID19/coronavirus, 2019). While preventing these types of events is impossible, having a better understanding of the transmission and death rates, as well as observing how the viruses change overtime, may be key to understanding and ultimately preparing for large scale epidemics. 

Our objective is to collect data related to SARS, H1N1, and COVID19 in order to analyze infection rates in specific countries as well as compare the transmission and death rates among the diseases.
