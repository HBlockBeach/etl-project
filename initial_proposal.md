# Pand√¶monium

From smallpox to typhoid, epidemics have plagued humans for all of history. In more recent history we have been hit by SARS-CoV (SARS, 2002), A/H1N1 (swine flu/spanish flu, 2009), and SARS-CoV2 (COVID19/coronavirus, 2019). While preventing these types of events is impossible, having a better understanding of the transmission and death rates, as well as observing how the viruses change overtime, may be key to understanding and ultimately preparing for large scale epidemics. 

Our objective is to collect data related to SARS, H1N1, and COVID19 in order to analyze infection rates in specific countries as well as compare the transmission and death rates among the diseases. 

## Data Sources:

### Kaggle: 
* COVID19 dataset
* SARS dataset
* H1N1 dataset

## Who does what?

### Data retrieval and cleaning: Ryan and Sean 
#### Retrieval: 
Who gets the CSVs- Ryan, pushed to github in resources
#### Cleaning:
Due: 4/22 night</br>
Extract county and use that</br>
Will we look week- first date + 7 days, rolling 7</br> 
Aggregate by dates- Total</br> 
* Ryan- H1N1: Weird characters in H1N1 data
* Sean- COVID 19: Things: region and country in same column- sars
### Data Modeling and Load: Hunter and Kafui
Due 4/22</br>
* Things: ERD- create schema- Miro
* Merging - joins using pandas
* Load using sqlalchemy into postgres         
### Web Development: Hunter and Ryan and Kafui
Work begins on 4/23        
## Wish list:
* Population data
